Employee Management System - Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
This is a fully functional Employee Management System built using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. The system allows for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee records. It is designed to manage employee data, including their names, emails, positions, and salaries. The application is built with RESTful APIs to perform the operations, and it uses PostgreSQL as the database to persist employee information.

Key Features:
Create Employee: Add new employee records with details such as name, email, position, and salary.
Read Employee: Retrieve employee details by ID or fetch all employee records.
Update Employee: Modify an existing employee's details by providing the employee ID.
Delete Employee: Remove an employee record based on the provided ID.
Technologies Used:
Java: The primary programming language used for backend development.
Spring Boot: A framework that simplifies the development of Java-based applications, enabling fast and efficient development of RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A relational database management system used to store and retrieve employee data.
JPA/Hibernate: Java Persistence API (JPA) with Hibernate for object-relational mapping (ORM) to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
Spring Data JPA: For easy integration with PostgreSQL and managing database operations.
